            <h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>

            <p><strong>Natural language processing</strong> (NLP) has played an important role in several computer science areas, and <strong>requirements engineering</strong> (RE) is not an exception. In the last years, the advent of massive and very heterogeneous natural language (NL) RE-relevant sources, like tweets and app reviews, has attracted even more interest from the RE community.</p>

            <p>The main <strong>goal</strong> of the NLP4RE&nbsp;workshop is&nbsp;to set up a regular meeting point for the researchers on NLP technologies in RE in which the advances, challenges and barriers that they encounter may be communicated, and collaborations may emerge naturally.</p>

            <p>This year, besides accepting contribution across the entire spectrum of NLP applications for RE, the workshop has an additional goal of <strong>building a benchmark</strong> for the community by introducing <a href="reqeval.html">ReqEval2020</a>, a shared task on detecting nocuous referential ambiguity in requirements specifications.</p>

            <h3><strong>Contributions</strong></h3>

            <p>The workshop will welcome <strong>contributions</strong> in the field of theory and application of NLP technologies in RE. We also encourage contributions that highlight challenges faced by industrial practitioners when dealing with requirements expressed in NL, and faced by academics in technology transfer studies.</p>

            <p>We are interested in <strong>Tool Papers</strong> (see the call for papers <a href="call-for-papers.html">here</a>), in which the authors provide a brief description of an NLP tool for RE, and a plan for a&nbsp;tool demo at the workshop.

            <p>We are also&nbsp;interested in <strong>Report Papers</strong>&nbsp;(see the call for papers <a href="call-for-papers.html">here</a>), in&nbsp;which the authors provide an overview on the current and past research of their teams. These contributions do not require novelty with respect to previous work, because the main goal of the workshop is to foster discussion and networking.&nbsp;A&nbsp;non-mandatory <strong>template</strong> for Report Papers can be dowloaded <a href="uploads/nlp4re-rp-template.pdf">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Within the area of NLP for RE, the <strong>topics of interest</strong> of the workshop include but are not limited to:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Requirements quality assessment</li>

              <li>Requirements datasets&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>

            <p>NLP4RE&nbsp;is co-located with the <a href="https://refsq.org/welcome/">26th International Working Conference on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ'20)</a>, Pisa, Italy, 24â€“27&nbsp;March, 2019.</p>
